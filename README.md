# Website for 'Dom Designs'

This project builds website for 'Dom Designs' - an interior design company <br>
with main office based in London UK and projects in Europe, US and Russia.

## Website URL

https://koleaby4.github.io/dom-designs

## Dom Designs' business goal

The main target we are trying to achieve by developing website for Dom Designs<br>
is to increase online presence in order to increase customer base<br>
and provide information about their business to potential customers.

## Customers' needs

Company's website should allow potential customers, who consider involving interior designers into their projects, to:

1.  Find the company's website online ([Story 31](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues/31)
    and [Story 28](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues/28))
2.  Find out about range of services offered by Dom Designs and compare them with competitors
    ([Story 12](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues/12) and [Story 13](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues/13))
3.  See photos of completed projects ([Story 14](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues/14)
    and [Story 15](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues/15))
4.  Read feedback from existing customers ([Story 16](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues/16)
    and [Story 17](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues/17))
5.  Find contact details and enquire about engaging Dom Designs into project work ([Story 18](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues/18)
    and [Story 19](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues/19))

## User Stories

All user stories have been tracked using GitHub's [issues section](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue),
which is a lightweight equivalent of [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), <br>
which is widely used for planning and tracking software development activities.

By default all tickets represent user stories.<br>
Example of a user story: [Build 'Testimonials' section for mobile view](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues/16)

Only tickets with 'bug' label, represent defects in code, which have been found during testing.
Example of a bug: [Contacts section is misaligned in IE11](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues/24)

Additional labels have been introduced to help categorising and filtering tasks:

1.  Non-functional requirements are marked [by NFR label](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3ANFR)
1.  Accessibility stories are marked [by a11y label](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aa11y)

Performance considerations 1. At the first stage of the project we want to [limit size of images to 300Kb](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues/30) 2. In the future, we want different resolution images to be used for [mobile](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues/3) and [desktops](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues/4) 3. Loading of JavaScript libraries is [deferred](https://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2014/02/async-vs-defer-attributes.html)

## Wireframes

Wireframes have been implemented using [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) <br>and attached to respective user stories.
In this way developers would know exactly what they should implement, which picking up respective stories.

Examples:

- [Desktop Contacts Section](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues/19)
- [Mobile Projects Section](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues/14)

## How we tested it

Functional tests have been carried out manually on regular basis using:

- Physical devices
  - Windows10 & Chrome desktop
  - Windows10 & IE11 desktop
  - Google Pixel 2 & Chrome mobile
- Virtual devices: Apple iPhone X via [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com)

Automated tests using [cypress](https://www.cypress.io) have been added to landing and services sections.
We also created a task to [add more automated tests](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues/20) in the future.

Two accessibility scanners were used to validate website:

- [aXe](https://www.deque.com/axe)
- [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)

Finally, a series of peer reviews helped identifying additional issues such as:

- A number of orthographic mistakes
- Gaps in documentation
- Text alignment on extra small devices ([Issue 32](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues/32))

### Known issues

All known defects have been captured as GitHub issues and [marked by 'bug' label](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abug).<br>
Example: [Occasional JS error seen in console when loading project photos](https://github.com/koleaby4/dom-designs/issues/24).

## How website was published

Website had been published into GitHub pages by following instructions provided in<br>
[Configuring a publishing source for GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages).

I truly believe it is a very clear set of instructions and trying to re-write them in my own words:

1.  Won't make them any better
2.  Will violate [KISS principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
